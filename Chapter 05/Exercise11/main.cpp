/*
 Write a program that writes out the first so many values of the Fibonacci
series, that is, the series that starts with 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34. The next
number of the series is the sum of the two previous ones. Find the largest
Fibonacci number that fits in an int.
 
 My solution uses a simple recursive algorithm to compute the Fibonacci numbers, and
 stores them in a vector up to the user_limit (this way the program is more modular)
